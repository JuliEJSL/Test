        <h3>Healthy Development</h3>
        <p>
          The early years of a child’s life are very important for his or her
          health and development. Healthy development means that children of all
          abilities, including those with special health care needs, are able to
          grow up where their social, emotional and educational needs are met.
          Having a safe and loving home and spending time with family―playing,
          singing, reading, and talking―are very important. Proper nutrition,
          exercise, and sleep also can make a big difference.

        <h3>Effective Parenting Practices</h3>
        <p>
          takes many different forms. However, some positive parenting practices
          work well across diverse families and in diverse settings when
          providing the care that children need to be happy and healthy, and to
          grow and develop well. A recent report looked at the evidence in
          scientific publications for what works, and found these key ways that
          parents can support their child’s healthy development:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>Responding to children in a predictable way</li>
          <li>Showing warmth and sensitivity</li>
          <li>Having routines and household rules</li>
          <li>Sharing books and talking with children</li>
          <li>Supporting health and safety</li>
          <li>Using appropriate discipline without harshness</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Parents who use these practices can help their child stay healthy, be
          safe, and be successful in many areas—emotional, behavioral,
          cognitive, and social.

        <h3>Developmental Milestones</h3>
        <p>
          Skills such as taking a first step, smiling for the first time, and
          waving “bye-bye” are called developmental milestones. Children reach
          milestones in how they play, learn, speak, behave, and move (for
          example, crawling and walking). Children develop at their own pace, so
          it’s impossible to tell exactly when a child will learn a given skill.
          However, the developmental milestones give a general idea of the
          changes to expect as a child gets older. As a parent, you know your
          child best. If your child is not meeting the milestones for his or her
          age, or if you think there could be a problem with your child’s
          development, talk with your child’s doctor and share your concerns.
          Don’t wait.

        <h3>Developmental Monitoring and Screening</h3>
        <p>
          Parents, grandparents, early childhood providers, and other caregivers
          can participate in developmental monitoring, which observes how your
          child grows and changes over time and whether your child meets the
          typical developmental milestones in playing, learning, speaking,
          behaving, and moving. Developmental screening takes a closer look at
          how your child is developing. A missed milestone could be a sign of a
          problem, so when you take your child to a well visit, the doctor,
          nurse, or another specialist might give your child a brief test, or
          you will complete a questionnaire about your child. If the screening
          tool identifies an area of concern, a formal developmental evaluation
          may be needed, where a trained specialist takes an in-depth look at a
          child’s development. If a child has a developmental delay, it is
          important to get help as soon as possible. When a developmental delay
          is not found early, children must wait to get the help they need to do
          well in social and educational settings.
